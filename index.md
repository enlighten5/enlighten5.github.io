## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="photo.JPG">

I am a 3rd-year Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at University of California, Riverside (UCR). I am lucky to be supervised by Prof. [Heng Yin](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~heng/).

## Research Interest

My research interests focus on computer security. I work on various program analysis techniques (dynamic emulation/virtualization, logic inference, etc.) to solve security-related problems, including vulnerability/gadget discovery, memory forensics, etc.   


Current research interest: bridge the semantic gap between raw memory bytes and structural kernel objects for memroy fornesics.
